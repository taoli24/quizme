This application is build around the **Open Trivia Database API** (https://opentdb.com/). <br>
All assets and source code are hosted at https://github.com/taoli24/quizme.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to  help user gain extra knowledge and getting better at quizzes.

## Code style

* snake_casing for function names and variable names
* All capital letters for constants
* Pacal casing for class names
* leading _ for private methods and variables
* Imports should be on separate lines
* Surrounding top level function and classes with two blank lines
* Use 4 spaces per indentation level

## Main features of this application

1. **The application utilise Open trivia database API for generating questions**
    * Quiz questions are retrieved from API from user chosen categories
    * User can choose quizzes from 24 different categories
    * User can choose number of questions (10-50)
    * There are two type of questions(true/false and multiple choice questions)

2. **This application uses OOP approach**
    * Questions class form the basis of a question object
    * MultipleChoiceQuestion class inherit from Question class and has one extra property - answer_list
    * Main logic are controlled by QuizControl class which serves a brain of the quiz app.
   
3. **All user inputs are validated before feed into the program**
    * This means user input are controlled in the way that only acceptable user input will be used in this application to prevent errors

4. **Different type of control logic are used in this application, this includes:**
    * if, else statements
    * for and while loops
    * recursive functions

5. **Error handling**
    * User input are handled in try except block
    * Network module has custom decorator function which helps handle errors that may occur when communicate with the API server, this also keeps code dry
